Well I Will create 2 modules 

1. Roads
2. Robot 

Roads modul will give me the idea of routing 
Robot will used to make both the random and goalOriented Robot

To walk the robot module will depend on Roads module 


Road Interface 
  a) constructor 
  b) Route 
  c) Village State 
  d) Build graph 
  e) roadGraph 

Robot Interface 
  a) Moving from start to destination 
  b) Random Pick 
  c) findRoute 

Using NPm package is better
